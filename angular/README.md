## Usage
This sample project demonstrates how to use the ezajil Chat Application SDK to implement real-time chat capabilities and presence tracking in an Angular application. It includes examples of creating users, creating chatrooms, sending and receiving messages, presence tracking, and more.

You can open multiple tabs in your browser, each with a different user logged in, to test the chat and presence capabilities. This allows you to simulate real-world scenarios where multiple users interact with each other in real-time.
